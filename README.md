# Computer Vision
In this repository you will learn about Computer Vision in python using OpenCv library.

## Libraries
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [OpenCv](https://opencv.org/)

## Installations
If you are using anaconda environment search on the web: conda library_name
I suggest creating a virtual environment and installing the libraries there.

1. **Create** new environment using this command: **python3 -m venv your_environment_name**
2. **Activate** the environment using this command: **source your_environment_name/bin/activate**
3. **Install** following libraries **Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCv** using **pip install library_name**
